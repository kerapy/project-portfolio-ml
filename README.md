##### Steps for running the notebooks:
- Recommend running in a virtual environment:  
    ``` python -m venv portfolio ```  
    Activate the virtual environment  
    ``` .\portfolio\Scripts\activate ```  
    Install the required packages  
    ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```  

- Run the notebooks in order: --> Data processing --> Model Training --> Model Evaluation  


This project focuses in deep learning models listed in the notebooks folder.  
1. CNN classfication model for cifar10 dataset.
2. GANs for generating new images based on Cifar10 dataset.  
3. RAG using ollama and langchain for question answering based on documents.
4. LSTM  model for temporal series from sensor data from machines.
5. Transformer (NLP) model for text classification using the IMDB dataset.
